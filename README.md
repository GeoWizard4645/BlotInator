# BlotInator
This code turns images into Blot Code.

The Image specified in the Image-Path (IMG_9654.png) in the Blot-Image.py gets converted into Blot Code in Seconds. 

Only Drawback is insane amount of lines drawn depending on details, keep photo as low and small as possible.

Feel free to use anywhere.

Note Doc Dimensions may need to be altered after cod edhas been generated. 

Thanks to Aditya Anand's Blotinator which I used as my basis. You can find that at: [https://github.com/Pymaster3119/Blot-Drawing-Version-2](url)
